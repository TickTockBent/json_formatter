- `Ctrl/Cmd + K` - Clear input

## Auto-Fix Feature

The JSON formatter includes a smart auto-fix feature that can repair common JSON errors automatically. When your JSON has syntax errors, a "Fix" button will appear that can handle:

### What It Fixes:
- **Trailing commas**: `{"name": "Alice",}` ‚Üí `{"name": "Alice"}`
- **Unquoted property names**: `{name: "Alice"}` ‚Üí `{"name": "Alice"}`
- **Single quotes**: `{'name': 'Alice'}` ‚Üí `{"name": "Alice"}`
- **Missing commas**: `{"a": 1 "b": 2}` ‚Üí `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`
- **Missing brackets**: `{"name": "Alice"` ‚Üí `{"name": "Alice"}`
- **Extra brackets**: `{"name": "Alice"}}` ‚Üí `{"name": "Alice"}`

### What It Won't Fix:
This is a lightweight tool designed for common copy/paste errors. For complex structural issues, consider using dedicated JSON repair tools.

**Perfect for**: Fixing JSON copied from code snippets, incomplete pastes, or data with wrong quote types.

## URL Sharing

### Generate Share Links
Click the "Share" button to automatically generate a shareable URL with your JSON data. The link is copied to your clipboard and can be shared with others.

### URL Parameters
You can also manually create links by appending `?json=` followed by URL-encoded JSON:
```
https://json.clocktowerassoc.com/?json=%7B%22name%22%3A%22Alice%22%7D
```

**Note**: URLs are limited to ~2,000 characters for broad compatibility. Large JSON files may not be shareable via URL.
